 This coding journey of mine began out of necessity ‚Äì to support my sick mother and escape poverty. Fueled by determination, I embraced coding through an intensive software development program thanks to a full-ride scholarship. Mastering algorithms and creative problem-solving became my passion and to be honest really fun and frustrating. 
 
 My background as a pharmacy tech instilled customer service expertise and empathy for others, enhancing my software development skills. My mother's health challenges inspired my resilience and adaptability, driving me to leverage technology for a better life for all no matter the ability. I Learned am a dedicated problem solver, eager to contribute my unique perspective and skills. currently I'm enrolled in [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), scheduled to graduate December,14,2023 and I can't wait to use my skills to help change the world using tech. 
 
 So,  Let's make a difference together.
